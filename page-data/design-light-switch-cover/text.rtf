My affinity for home automation has lead me to buy my share of internet connected light bulbs.  One thing that has frustrated me is that the switches to control these lights usually come with an adhesive mount to stick them directly on the wall.  The problem with this is that the conventional light switch that controls the socket is still there and can cut power to the device if it\'92s flipped.  Lucky for me, I work for a company that specializes in making arbitrary plastic parts!  To kill 2 birds with 1 stone, I designed a mount for my Philips Hue switch that fits over an existing standard light switch to securely mount the Hue switch to the wall (no adhesives) and cover the existing light switch in order to prevent it from being accidentally turned off.}
